                    <p className={styles.sectionText}>
                        MoonStore is an online storefront platform that gives
                        African vendors their own branded store page where
                        buyers can browse products and place orders via
                        WhatsApp. MoonStore is not a marketplace. We do not
                        sell products ourselves. We provide the tools for
                        sellers to sell.
