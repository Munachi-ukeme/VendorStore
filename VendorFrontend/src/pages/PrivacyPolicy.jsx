                    MoonStore is committed to protecting your privacy. This
                    policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your
                    information when you use our platform, whether you are
                    a seller managing your store or a buyer browsing products.

                    <p className={styles.sectionText}>
                        MoonStore is an online storefront platform that helps
                        African Instagram and WhatsApp vendors showcase their
                        products and receive orders directly on WhatsApp.
                        MoonStore is not a marketplace. Each seller has their
                        own independent store.

                        For sellers we collect your business name, email
                        address, WhatsApp number, physical address, and
                        store information you provide during setup. We also
                        store your product listings and category information.
                    </p>
                    <p className={styles.sectionText}>
                        For buyers we do not require you to create an account.
                        When you click Order Now your browser opens WhatsApp
                        directly. We do not collect or store your personal
                        information as a buyer.

                        We collect basic analytics data such as store visits
                        and product clicks to help sellers understand their
                        store performance. This data is anonymous and not
                        linked to individual buyers.

                        policy. MoonStore does not process payments directly, no card or banking details pass through our platform.
